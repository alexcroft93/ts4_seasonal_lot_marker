# ts4_seasonal_lot_marker
Seasonal lot marker for the sims 4 inspired by the sims 3 

Hey everyone!

I’ve been trying to make a mod for The Sims 4 that works like the Seasonal Lot Marker from The Sims 3. Basically, it automatically swaps objects on the lot based on the current season. I've got something working, but I'm hitting a few snags.

Right now, the script does the following:

You add objects to the lot.

You use commands like seasonal.snapshot_save spring/summer/winter/fall to assign those objects to specific seasons.

When the game switches to that season, the objects get placed automatically on the lot.

The problem is that it only works within the current lot. If you leave the lot or switch to a different one, the functionality gets lost—like it’s overwritten. Also, making it work for the savegame itself is out of my current skill level, and I just don’t have the time to dig deeper into it.

If anyone who’s good with Python and scripting wants to take a look, I can upload the code to my GitHub. Hopefully, someone can take what I've started and finally get this working in The Sims 4!

Thanks, and fingers crossed someone can pick this up!
